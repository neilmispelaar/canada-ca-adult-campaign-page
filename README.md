# Adult Learning Campaign Page

This repo contains the HTML and CSS code for building the Adult Learning Campaign pages.

## CSS

As a general rule, Bootstrap and WET ultility classes were used as a first step, and then anything I couldn't do with those base styles I wrote custom CSS to fill in the gaps.  

If you are interested in the CSS you can find it here: 

* [CSS File](https://github.com/neilmispelaar/canada-ca-adult-campaign-page/blob/master/static/css/adult-campaign.css) 

## HTML Code 

Nothing overly special was done with the HTML. 

You can find the source for the pages here:
