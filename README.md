Instructions to come 

## Ingredients for the Project 

### CSS

As a general rule, Bootstrap and WET ultility classes were used as a first step, and then anything I couldn't do with those base styles I wrote custom CSS to fill in the gaps.  

If you are interested in the CSS you can find it here:

### HTML 

Nothing overly special was done with the HTML.
